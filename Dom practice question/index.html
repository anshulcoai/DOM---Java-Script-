    <div id="div1">Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher.[6] Newton was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed.[7] Newton's book Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics.[8][9] Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz.[10][11] He contributed to and refined the scientific method, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science</div>

  <p id="para2" style="font-size:22px;">A cradle of civilization, Iran has been inhabited since the Lower Palaeolithic. The large part of Iran was first<br>
     unified as a political entity by the Medes under Cyaxares in the seventh century BC, and reached its territorial height<br>
     in the sixth century BC, when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Empire, one of the largest in ancient history. Alexander<br>

     BC and liberated the country, which was succeeded by the Sasanian Empire in the third century AD.</p>
